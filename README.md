# Hey there 👋

I’m a full-stack developer with a growing passion for both frontend and backend technologies. I recently graduated from college and have years ahead of me to dive deeper into coding, explore new technologies, and take on exciting projects. My goal is to keep building, learning, and growing as a developer.

I'm always looking for ways to improve, and I'm constantly inspired by trailblazers in the tech world, like **Steve Wozniak**. Oh, and if you’ve played **Watch Dogs**, you’ll understand how much I’m inspired by the way technology shapes the world around us.

🌱 Always learning about **everything**  
💻 Just coding for fun!  
🚀 Passionate about technology, open source, and building cool stuff



## 🎯 Goals for Upcoming Years

- Deepen increase my understanding of backend development (Node.js, APIs, and programming languages).
- Build a few full-stack applications and contribute to open-source projects.
- Improve my problem-solving skills (by solving challenges on platforms like LeetCode, CodeWars, etc.).

## 💡 Inspiration
I’m inspired by:


- **Steve Wozniak** – Co-founder of Apple and the creative force behind the Apple I and Apple II computers, which played a major role in shaping the personal computing industry.
- **Linus Torvalds** – Creator of Linux, an open-source operating system that powers much of the web today and continues to be a foundation for developers and system admins worldwide.
- **Guido van Rossum** – Creator of Python. His work has made programming easier, more intuitive, and widely adopted across various industries.
- **Dennis Ritchie** – Co-creator of the C programming language. His contributions to the world of programming have had a monumental impact on software development.
- **James Gosling** – Creator of Java. His vision for a language that could run on any device revolutionized software development across platforms.

Additionally, I’m deeply inspired by **Watch Dogs**, the game. The way it blends technology, hacking, and the digital world is a major motivator for me as I pursue a career in tech. I aim to build systems and applications that allow for creative solutions, much like the characters in the game.
